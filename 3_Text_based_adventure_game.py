"""
This is a basic version of the Adventure game. It is completely text-based. In this version of the game,
users can move about through different rooms within a single setting, and based on the user input,
it will provide descriptions for each room. This is one of the interesting python projects.
Movement direction is crucial here â€“ you must create walls and set the directions in which the users can move
through the rooms, set movement restrictions, and also include a tracker that can track how far a user has walked
or moved in the game. Mentioning Python projects can help your resume look much more interesting than others.
